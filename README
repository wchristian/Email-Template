Email-Template

This is a fairly simple interface to generate "multipart/alternative"
emails with both "text/html" and "text/plain" components using a single
HTML based Template Toolkit template.

The HTML, once processed by Template Toolkit, is converted to text
using HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables. Both HTML and text ver‐
sions are then attached and sent via MIME::Lite.

Be sure to validate your sender and recipient addresses first (ie.
Email::Valid−>rfc822 ).
